QuickSort
=======================

| QuickSort is a divide and conquer algorithm. 
| It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. 
| There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways: 

* Always pick the first element as a pivot
* Always pick the last element as a pivot
* Pick a random element as a pivot
* Pick median as a pivot

| Here we will be picking the last element as a pivot. 
| The key process in quickSort is partition(). 
| Target of partitions is, given an array and an element x of array as a pivot, put x at its correct position in a sorted array and put all smaller elements (smaller than x) before x, and put all greater elements (greater than x) after x. 
| All this should be done in linear time.

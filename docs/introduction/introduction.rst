| Algorithms are Step-by-step procedures to solve a problem.
| Key aspects of algorithms include control structures and their pseudocode.
| There are many examples of using python in maths.

Control structures
--------------------

| Control flow is the execution order of instructions or functions in a program. 
| Flow of control is implemented via control structures:
| • 	sequence, which executes line by line in written order
| • 	selection, which chooses between alternatives
| • 	iteration, where looping determines how many times the instruction is executed.

| Algorithms are Step-by-step procedures to solve a problem.
| This section covers some key aspects of algorithms, including control structures and their pseudocode.

Control structures
--------------------

| Control flow is the execution order of instructions or functions in a program. 
| Flow of control is implemented via control structures:
| • 	sequence, which executes line by line in written order
| • 	selection, which chooses between alternatives
| • 	iteration, where looping determines how many times the instruction is executed.

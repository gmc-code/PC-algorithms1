----

| An instruction is a unit of code. There are two types: definitions and statements.

----

Definitions
--------------------------

| A definition is an instruction that assigns a value to a variable.

.. code-block:: python

    num = 7


| **Pseudocode**. Assignment uses a left point arrow in pseudocode.
| The equivalent pseudocode is:

.. code-block::

    num <- 7


----

Statements
--------------------------

| A statement is a single line of code that performs an action.


.. code-block:: python

   print(a)

| **Pseudocode**. The equivalent pseudocode is:

.. code-block::

    OUTPUT a

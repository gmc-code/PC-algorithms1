Selection
==========================

| Selection is one of the three basic control structures.
| Selection provides alternatives or branching using ``if`` ... ``elif`` ... ``else``.
| Selection tests condition that evaluate to True or False.
| The logical operators, ``and``, ``or``, and ``not`` increase the options for testing conditions.

If, else
----------------------------

| ``if`` is used with a condition that results in ``True`` or ``False``.
| When the condition is True, the code indented below the ``if`` statement is executed.
| If all conditions are ``False``, ``else:`` can be used to execute other code.

.. code-block:: python

   score = 65
   cut_off_score = 60
   if score >= cut_off_score:
      print("Suitable standard.")
   else:
      print("Do a retest.")

| **Pseudocode**. The equivalent pseudocode is:

.. code-block::

   BEGIN
      score <- 65
      cut_off_score <- 60
      IF score >= cut_off_score THEN
         OUTPUT "Suitable standard."
      ELSE
         OUTPUT "Do a retest."
      ENDIF
   END

            | ``if score >= cut_off_score`` becomes ``if 65 >= 60:``

            | Give a value for ``score`` in the code above such that the output is ``"Do a retest."``.
            | "Do a retest." is in the False branch.
            | So the score is below 60. e.g. 59

            | Assuming scores can only be integers from and including 0 to 100, how many different scores would result in the output of ``"Do a retest."``?

            | There are 41 scores.

----

If, elif, else
----------------------------

| Alternatives can be provided using ``elif`` with a condition.
| Note that there must be a colon, ``:``, at the end of each ``if``, ``elif`` and ``else`` statement.

.. code-block:: python

   if scoreA > scoreB:

| Nesting is the inclusion of other ``if`` statements within ``if`` statements.
| Both the ``if`` and the ``elif`` below have a nested ``if`` and ``else`` that are used when their condition is true.

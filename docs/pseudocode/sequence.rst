Sequence
==========================

| A sequence is a set of instructions like a recipe. 
| Every line of code in the sequence is run in the order that it is written.


.. code-block:: python

   print("What is your name?")
   name = input("Enter your name?")
   print("Hello, " + name + ". Nice to meet you.")

| **Pseudocode**. The equivalent pseudocode is:

.. literalinclude:: pythonfiles/sequence_pseudo.

.. code-block::

   BEGIN
      PRINT "What is your name?"
      name <- INPUT ("Enter your name?")
      PRINT "Hello, " + name + ". Nice to meet you."
   END

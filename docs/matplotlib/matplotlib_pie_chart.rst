Matplotlib pie chart
====================================================

| Matplotlib can be used to draw a pie chart.
| By default, the plotting of the first wedge starts from the x-axis and moves counterclockwise.
| The size of each wedge is determined by comparing the value with all the other values, by using this formula: the value divided by the sum of all values: x/sum(x)

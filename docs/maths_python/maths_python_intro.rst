Introduction to maths python
=============================


| Examples of using python to implement mathematical algorithms are illustrated in the following pages.
| From the list below, those in bold are implemented here.

----

| 5	Follow a mathematical algorithm involving branching and repetition (iteration) (VCMNA194)

	* **simulating a simple random walk**
	* manipulating sets of numbers using a given rule, for example, if a number is even halve it; if a number is odd, subtract 1 then halve it

----

| 6	Design algorithms involving branching and iteration to solve specific classes of mathematical problems (VCMNA221)

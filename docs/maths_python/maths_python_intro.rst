Introduction to maths python
=============================

| Examples of using python to implement mathematical algorithms are illustrated in the following pages.
| Form the lsit below, those in bold are implemented here.

| 7	Design and implement mathematical algorithms using a simple general purpose programming language (VCMNA254)

	* **Finding the sum of a set of consecutive numbers using a loop structure**
	* **Constructing geometric patterns such as a honeycomb, using dynamic geometry functionality**

| 8	Use algorithms and related testing procedures to identify and correct errors (VCMNA282)

	* Debugging search and sort programs
	* **Testing a number for divisibility**

| 9	Apply set structures to solve real-world problems (VCMNA307)

	* Using a sort algorithm to determine the median of a set of numbers
	* Exploring variation in proportion and means of random samples, drawn from a population

| 10 Implement algorithms using data structures in a general-purpose programming language (VCMNA334) 

	* Using two-dimensional arrays such as matrices to represent and implement sequences of transformations of sets of points in the plane
	* Using pointers in algorithms

| 10A Devise and use algorithms and simulations to solve mathematical problems (VCMNA358)

	* Applying a systematic guess-check-and-refine algorithm to identify an approximate value for the root of an equation in an interval
	* Developing simulations for counter-intuitive problems in probability such as the Monty Hall problem or derangements

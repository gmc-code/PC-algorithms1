* Debugging search and sort programs

----

Errors and debugging
-----------------------

| An error in code is called a bug. 
| Correcting the errors in code is called debugging.
| Debugging includes checking that the algorithm returns the correct output from a given input.
| To help find errors in the code, test smaller sections of the code by printing the result part way to see if, at that point, it is correct.

----

Checking that a list has been sorted in ascending order
--------------------------------------------------------

| The list, [12, 13, 14, 16, 12, 17], is not sorted in ascending order.
| The number 12 at index 4 is out of order.
| The function below can be used to indicate that the list was not sorted correctly.
| A second list, that is correctly sorted, is included as well.

| To use mathematical modelling to investigate the proportion of land mass/area of Aboriginal Peoples' traditional grain belt compared with Australia's current grain belt, estimate the following:

* The total land area of Australia
* The land area of the current wheat belt
* The land area of the Indigenous grain belt


| According to Wikipedia, the total land area of Australia is **7.7 million square kilometres**. 
| See: https://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/national-location-information/dimensions/area-of-australia-states-and-territories
| The land area of the current wheat belt is estimated to be **460,000 square kilometres**. 
| See: http://www.consortiumland.com/investors/introduction-to-the-australian-wheatbelt/
| It seems that the Indigenous grain belt with native grasses covers a similar or slightly larger area than the current wheat belt, but this is just a guess.

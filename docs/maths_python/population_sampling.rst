* Exploring variation in proportion and means of random samples, drawn from a population

----

| The code below generates a population of 10000 individuals with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. 
| It then draws random samples of a given size from the population and calculates the sample means. 
| Finally, it plots histograms of the sample means to visualize their variation.

| Increasing the number of samples drawn from a population generally leads to more accurate estimates of the population mean. 
| This is because as the number of samples increases, the distribution of sample means tends to become more tightly clustered around the true population mean. 
| This phenomenon is known as the Central Limit Theorem.


| In other words, as the number of samples increase, the sample means are more likely to be close to the population mean, and the variation among the sample means decreases. 
| This can be seen in the histograms above: as the number of samples increases, the histograms become taller and narrower, indicating that the sample means are becoming more concentrated around the population mean.

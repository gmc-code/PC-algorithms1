----

Simple rule
------------------------

----

Even numbers
------------------------

| Return a set of even numbers.

.. literalinclude:: files/sets_of_numbers_even.py
    :linenos:

----

Sum numbers in sequence
------------------------

| Return a list of numbers that are a running total as each member of the set is added to the running total.

Highest common factor
=======================

Euclidean algorithm
---------------------------

See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm 


| The **highest common factor** is known as the greatest common divisor, gcd.
| The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the **highest common factor** of two numbers does not change if the larger number is replaced by its difference with the smaller number. 
| For example, 6 is the HCF of 48 and 18 (as 48 = 8 x 6 and 18 = 3 x 6), and the same number 6 is also the HCF of 18 and 30 (obtained by 48 - 18; taking 3 sixes from 8 sixes leaves 5 sixes). 
| Since this replacement reduces the larger of the two numbers, repeating this process gives successively smaller pairs of numbers until the two numbers become equal. 
| 48 and 18 becomes 30 and 18 which becomes 18 and 12 which becomes 12 and 6 which becomes 6 and 6.
| When that occurs, they are the HCF of the original two numbers.

HCF by repeated subtraction
------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

    import random


    def hcf_sub(a, b):
        while a != b:
            if a > b:
                a = a - b
            else:
                b = b - a
        return a

    a = 48
    b = 18
    hcf = hcf_sub(a, b)
    print(a, b, hcf)

HCF by repeatedly getting remainders from division
---------------------------------------------------

| Instead of repeated subtractions, a division can be used to get the remainder that would occur if all the possible subtractions of that number were be done at once.
| Starting wiht 48 and 18, instead of subtracting 18 from 48, subtract the largest multiple of 18 that is less than 48. 
| 48 - 2*18 = 12. Note that 48//18 gives 2. **//** is floor division, rounding down to an integer.

| The code below runs the while loop until **b** equals 0.
| **b** is stored in **t** so b can be calculated, then **a** is set to **t**.
| An example of **b = a - (a // b) * b** is **b = 48 - (48//19)*18**, which is b = 48 - 36 = 12.

.. code-block:: python

    import random


    def hcf_div(a, b):
        while b != 0:
            t = b
            b = a - (a // b) * b
            a = t
        return a


    a = 48
    b = 18
    hcf = hcf_div(a, b)
    print(a, b, hcf)


| The line above, **b = a - (a // b) * b**, can be replaced by **b = a % b**, which finds the remainder from division.

.. code-block:: python

    import random

        
    def hcf_mod(a, b):
        while b != 0:
            t = b
            b = a % b
            a = t
        return a


    a = 48
    b = 18
    hcf = hcf_mod(a, b)
    print(a, b, hcf)

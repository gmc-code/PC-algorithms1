=======================

| VC2M6A03: level 6: Design and use algorithms involving a sequence of steps and decisions that use rules to generate sets of numbers; identify, interpret and explain emerging patterns

	* using an algorithm to create extended number sequences involving rational numbers, using a rule and digital tools, and explaining any emerging patterns

Fraction sequence
---------------------

| Fraction sequence returns the fractions as strings.

.. literalinclude:: files/fraction_sequence.py
    :linenos:

| Sample output is:

.. parsed-literal::

    Generated sequence: ['1/3', '2/3', '1', '4/3', '5/3', '2', '7/3', '8/3', '3', '10/3']
    The pattern is: Every third number is an integer.
